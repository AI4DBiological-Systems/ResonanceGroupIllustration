# ResonanceGroupIllustration
Illustration for the resonance grouping method from our NMR signal modelling work.

Plots obtained from batch.jl from the NMRSpectraSimulator.jl package.

Visualizations of our resonance grouping on simulated spectra of a few compounds can be found at this repo's GitHub webpage:
